In the volatile and fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, detecting anomalous or suspicious activity is crucial for maintaining security and trust in exchanges. This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify deviations from normal transaction behavior in Bitcoin data, enabling improved fraud detection mechanisms.
In this project two deep learning models were used Autoencoder and GAN .

Key Features

* Anomaly Detection Using RNN Autoencoder: Implements an RNN Autoencoder to detect unusual patterns in Bitcoin transactions by analyzing deviations from predicted norms.
* Forecasting Future Transactions: Uses an RNN Regressor to forecast future transaction values, allowing early detection of potential anomalies in expected behavior.
* Other Model Options: Includes additional machine learning models to provide flexibility in anomaly detection and forecasting based on the dataset characteristics.
* Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering steps, including data normalization, aggregation, and encoding of relevant transaction features, to ensure effective modeling.

Results
* Anomaly Detection: The RNN Autoencoder successfully identifies anomalous transactions, reducing false-positive rates, and improving detection robustness.
* Forecasting: The RNN Regressor provides reliable forecasts of future transactions, enabling preemptive anomaly detection.
